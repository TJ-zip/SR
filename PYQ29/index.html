Examples include:\nA. bottles (singular: bottle, plural: bottles)\nB. men (singular: man, plural: men)\nC. cars (singular: car, plural: cars)\nD. money is an uncountable noun. It refers to a concept or substance that cannot be counted individually. We cannot say \"one money\" or \"two moneys.\" Instead, we use terms like \"some money\" or \"a lot of money.\"\nThus, money is the incorrect option for a countable noun."

After is a preposition that indicates a relative time (e.g., \"after the meeting\") and does not refer to a specific point or period in time like the others.\nThus, After does not match the group."

                answer: "(A), (B), (C) and (D).",
                explanation: "An irregular verb is a verb that does not follow the standard rules of conjugation in English. Unlike regular verbs, which form their past tense and past participle by adding -ed or -d to the base form (e.g., \"walk\" → \"walked\"), irregular verbs have unique forms for their past tense and past participle. These forms must be memorized because they do not follow a predictable pattern.\nSo, all the combinations (A, B, C, and D) are correct examples of irregular verbs. There is no incorrect option in this list."

                explanation: "The phrase \"travelling by train\" is the correct usage. The preposition \"by\" is used to indicate the means of transportation (e.g., by car, by bus, by plane, by train).\nThe other options are incorrect:\n• A. on: Used for surfaces or modes like \"on foot\" or \"on a bus\" (when referring to being inside the vehicle).\n• B. with: Used to indicate accompaniment or tools, not means of transportation.\n• C. at: Used to indicate location or time, not means of transportation."

Compound: This type of sentence consists of two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (e.g., \"T wanted to go, but it was raining.*\"). Coordinating Conjunctions can be remembered as FANBOYS where F=For, A=And, N=Nor, B=But, 0=0r, Y=Yet, S=So. (Note: \"for\" is not used as a coordinating conjunction in modern English)\n• D. Simple: This type of sentence consists of a single independent clause (e.g., \"We shall miss the show.\"). You can identify simple sentence by the use of one finite verb."

A preposition is not a linking word; it is a word that shows the relationship between a noun (or pronoun) and another word in the sentence (e.g. \"The book is on the table\"). Linking words are conjunctions (e.g., \"and,\" \"but,\" \"because\").\nStatement (Il): An interjection is a word that expresses sudden feeling. This statement is correct.

                explanation: "The original sentence is in the superlative degree ('one of the most important'). To change it to the positive degree using 'as...as', we use 'Very few...' because the original compares one item to a group it belongs to. Option (B) 'Very few other physical factors are as important as temperature' correctly changes it to the positive degree. Option (A) is incorrect as it implies temperature is as important as all physical factors combined. Option (C) is an incorrect comparative form."

                answer: "Was elected",
                explanation: "The sentence describes a past event (1938) and the subject (Subash Chandra Bose) received the action (being elected). This requires the past passive voice, which is formed with 'was/were + past participle'. The past participle of 'elect' is 'elected'. Thus, 'Was elected' is correct."

                explanation: "Imperative sentences give commands, orders, requests, or advice. Option A reports an order ('Teacher ordered Mohan to leave...').

                answer: "The teacher ordered Ashok to go away.",
                explanation: "The direct speech \"Go away\" is a command. When converting an imperative sentence (command) to indirect speech, the reporting verb 'said to' is changed to 'ordered', 'commanded', 'told', etc., and the imperative verb is changed to an infinitive ('to' + verb). Therefore, 'ordered Ashok to go away' is the correct form."

The statement explains how anger *can* be channelised proactively as energy and that doing so is a skill, but it doesn't explicitly state that anger *must* or *needs* to be channelised. It's presented as an option or a perspective.\nAssumption B: 'Only skilled people can channelise anger to energy.' Since the statement explicitly calls the act of channelising anger a 'skill', it implies that skill is required. Therefore, it assumes that skilled people are the ones who can do it effectively.\nHence, only Assumption B is implicitly suggested by the statement."
